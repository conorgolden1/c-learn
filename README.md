# README

## Overview
This repository is a collection of C programs designed to facilitate learning through the implementation of various algorithms and data structures. The primary focus is on building a personal library (`mylib`) containing these implementations.

### Key Components
- **mylib/**: Contains source files for various data structures.
  - `doublylinkedlist.c` and `doublylinkedlist.h`: Implementation of a doubly linked list.
  - `linkedList.c` and `linkedList.h`: Implementation of a singly linked list.
  - `list.c` and `list.h`: General list implementations and utilities.
- **main.c**: Entry point for testing and running implementations.
- **mylib.h**: Header file to include the library functions.
- **Makefile**: Contains build instructions and commands.

## Build and Run Instructions
- **Build the Project**:
  ```sh
  make
  ```

- **Clean the Build**:
  ```sh
  make clean
  ```

- **Build and Run the Executable**:
  ```sh
  make run
  ```

## Usage
Compile the library and the main program using the provided `Makefile`. The `main.c` file serves as an entry point where you can test the different data structures and algorithms implemented in the library.

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests. Contributions that improve the clarity, efficiency, or scope of the algorithms and data structures are welcome.
